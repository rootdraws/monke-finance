# MONKE.finance Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive analytics platform for pump.fun tokens providing cost basis analysis, holder psychology insights, and LP optimization tools for the Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon.

## Infrastructure Context
- **Production Server**: data-strumpet (104.131.6.250) with managed PostgreSQL
- **API Access**: Solana Tracker Premium (10M monthly requests)
- **Target Market**: Graduated pump.fun communities ($5-10k revenue per client)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Complete historical transaction data from token launch
