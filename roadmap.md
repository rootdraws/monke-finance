# MONKE.finance Development Roadmap

## Core Strategic Objective
Building an **irreplaceable historical data asset** for pump.fun tokens that competitors cannot reconstruct, enabling premium cost basis analytics and holder psychology insights for $5-10k per community.

## The Historical Data Problem
- **Challenge**: Solana Tracker and other providers have limited historical data windows
- **Opportunity**: Tokens graduate unpredictably, creating data gaps for competitors
- **Solution**: Start collecting complete transaction history from day 1 for ALL new launches
- **Competitive Advantage**: Complete historical datasets that become impossible to replicate over time

---

## Infrastructure Status (Production Ready)
- **Server**: data-strumpet (104.131.6.250) - 16GB/8vCPU
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL with automated backups
- **API Access**: Solana Tracker Premium (10M monthly requests)
- **Cost**: $558/month operational
- **Capacity**: 3,000+ simultaneous token streams

## Codebase Status
### ✅ Already Built (Professional Foundation)
- **Project Structure**: Professional TypeScript setup with backend/frontend separation
- **Database Schema**: 8-table schema optimized for cost basis tracking and analytics
- **FIFO Cost Basis Engine**: Complete algorithm for profit/loss calculations
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Real-time data collection with reconnection handling
- **Transaction Processor**: Queue-based processing with ACID compliance
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Production-grade Winston logging system

### 🔧 Needs Integration
- **Official Solana Tracker SDK**: Use where appropriate while maintaining data collection
- **TradingView Charts**: Integrate using their official examples
- **Historical Data Strategy**: Bridge API limitations with our complete datasets

---

## Revised Development Strategy

### Our Competitive Moat
1. **Complete Historical Data**: Start collecting from launch for ALL new tokens
2. **Dual-Phase Tracking**: Monitor both pump curve AND post-graduation phases
3. **FIFO Cost Basis**: Calculate precise holder positions using complete transaction history
4. **Professional Infrastructure**: Enterprise-grade data collection and processing

### Integration with Solana Tracker SDK

#### Official SDK Capabilities (`@solana-tracker/data-api`)
```typescript
import { Client, Datastream } from '@solana-tracker/data-api';

// REST API - What they provide
const tokenInfo = await client.getTokenInfo('tokenAddress');       // Current metadata
const tokenHolders = await client.getTokenHolders('tokenAddress'); // Current holder list
const tokenStats = await client.getTokenStats('tokenAddress');     // Live statistics
const priceHistory = await client.getPriceHistory('tokenAddress'); // Limited historical prices
const topHolders = await client.getTopHolders('tokenAddress');     // Top 10 holders
const walletPnL = await client.getWalletPnL('walletAddress');      // Current P&L (limited history)

// Real-time WebSocket - What they stream
dataStream.subscribe.price.token(tokenAddress).on((priceData) => {
  console.log(`Price: $${priceData.price}`);
});
dataStream.subscribe.holders(tokenAddress).on((holderData) => {
  console.log(`Total holders: ${holderData.total}`);
});
dataStream.subscribe.stats.token(tokenAddress).on((stats) => {
  console.log('Live stats:', stats['24h']);
});
```

#### Hybrid Integration Strategy

**What We Use FROM Their SDK:**
- **Current Token Info**: `getTokenInfo()` for metadata and status
- **Real-time Price Feeds**: `subscribe.price.token()` for live updates
- **TradingView Integration**: Their chart examples as foundation
- **Current Holder Snapshots**: `getTokenHolders()` for validation

**What We Build OURSELVES:**
- **Complete Historical Collection**: From token launch through all phases
- **FIFO Cost Basis Tracking**: Using our complete transaction datasets
- **Pump Curve Data**: Pre-graduation transaction history
- **Holder Psychology Analysis**: Based on complete position history

#### Technical Integration Points

**1. Replace Our WebSocket Client (Partially):**
```typescript
// OLD: Our custom implementation for everything
import { getSolanaTrackerClient } from './services/solanaTrackerClient';

// NEW: Hybrid approach
import { Datastream, Client } from '@solana-tracker/data-api';

// Use their SDK for current data
const currentData = await client.getTokenInfo(tokenAddress);

// Use our collection for complete historical analysis
const completeHistory = await ourHistoricalDataService.getComplete(tokenAddress);
```

**2. Data Pipeline Architecture:**
```typescript
// Phase 1: Launch Detection (Our System)
newTokenDetected → startHistoricalCollection → trackPumpCurve

// Phase 2: Graduation (Hybrid)
graduationDetected → transitionToAMM → integrateWithSDK

// Phase 3: Ongoing (SDK + Our Historical)
currentData = await client.getTokenStats(tokenAddress);
historicalCostBasis = await ourFIFOEngine.calculate(completeHistory);
```

**3. Cost Basis Calculation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Their API: Limited historical window
const theirPnL = await client.getWalletPnL(walletAddress); // Last 30-90 days?

// Our Advantage: Complete history from launch
const ourCostBasis = await calculateFIFOFromLaunch(tokenAddress, walletAddress);
// Includes pump curve transactions that their API may not have
```

#### Chart Integration Using Their Examples
- **Base**: Use `solana-chart-example` as TradingView foundation
- **Overlay**: Add our cost basis heatmap on top of their price charts  
- **Data Feed**: Hybrid data feed combining their real-time + our historical
- **Psychology Zones**: Visual indicators based on complete holder history

#### API Rate Optimization
- **Current Data**: Use their efficient endpoints for live updates
- **Historical Queries**: Use our database for deep historical analysis
- **Smart Caching**: Cache their API responses, rely on our data for history
- **Backup Strategy**: Our collection ensures continuity if their API has issues
